Furthermore, it is stipulated that these plantations are to be certified under a Voluntary Carbon Market certification scheme with the intent of producing carbon credits while creating climate impact.
The farms in question have been subject to logging of commercially valuable species since the 1970s. Subsequently, during the colonization of East Panama (Cañitas-Tortí 1970's and 1980's), the lands have been deforested and gradually degraded by repetitive slash-and-burn processes and conversion to pasture.
At the time of reforestation, the vegetation cover of the farms includes wooded pastures with native and improved grasses, as well as areas of stubble mostly in their different stages of development between 1-5 years of age. The only economic activity has been extensive cattle ranching in pasture areas. 
Furthermore, the project aims to improve the livelihoods of local populations, in special regards to women head-of-family, by incrementing their participation in the activities. The tree nurseries, a central piece to the plantations, aims to hire only women under this description, providing also training in several areas to ensure a stable income and tangible professional progression. 
The project is also committed to the conservation of endangered wildlife. There is evidence that the project area is transverse by wild fauna currently part of the IUCN Red List, collected by using trap cameras. The aim of the carbon certification is to create conditions to expand the program to monitor this wildlife as part of the conservation effort.

Irokko  will ensure long-term land use change through the afforestation of the project areas that meet the  eligibility criteria outlined below. 

The project will increase the biomass carrying capacity of project areas by restoring them to original high biomass content forest conditions. The project will remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through the growth of softwood and Harwood. 

Each project area to be added in future will be  subject to a 70-year period of growth and to a 50-year crediting period for which the total emission reduction and sequestration will be quantified.

During subsequent financing periods, additional project areas will be added following the new area certification rules and shall contribute to the total sequestered tCO2eq.

Currently, most cooking in Togo is done with firewood and charcoal using traditional stoves such as three-stone fires and Malgache stoves. These inefficient stoves have significant impacts on health, forest degradation, and emission of greenhouse gases.  This project aims to enable the production and distribution of 200,000 improved cookstoves within 5 years, beginning in autumn 2022. Firewood users will have access to Himalayan cookstoves (produced by local potters using clay and other materials provided by the households themselves) and charcoal users will have access to Asuto cookstoves (portable stoves made up of a ceramic core and metal envelope). Evidence shows that these improved stoves can reduce fuel consumption by around 30%  compared to traditional stoves. The project targets households and artisans in the Plateaux, Maritime, and Centrale regions of Togo, which comprises about two-thirds to Togo’s total population. The cookstoves distributed through this project intend to be subsidized at 50% of the full price and come with a 5-year guarantee on potential defects. In addition to the distribution of subsidized cookstoves, the project will also support the local production of the stoves by identifying and providing technical and marketing training to 100 local potters and 30 local welders, as well as implement education and awareness activities on environmental and other benefits of improved cookstoves.

Taiwan is a biologically diversified island, in the past agriculture as the main production, now is dominated by high-tech, semiconductor and other industries, Taiwan still has millions of small farmers, responsible for the supply of 236 million Taiwanese main grain and small part of the export. Taiwan itself is an island with the earth's plates collided up, located on the Tropic of Cancer, with a land area of 36,000 square kilometers, 268 high mountains of more than 3,000 meters, high mountains and rapid rivers and streams, natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, heavy rainstorms, landslides, the soil is relatively poor, the soil lack of organic matters, the introduction of conventional agriculture for more than half a century, a large number of farmland soil acidified, lack of organic matter is common situation.

The use of the Gold Standard Global Goal’s Soil Organic Carbon Framework Methodology for Small Farmers’ Carbon Farming is able to encourage Taiwan's governments and farmers to adopt more environmentally sound, soil, food security, healthy farming practices for farmers and consumers, and more importantly, participate in global climate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It also motivates small farmers in action on the 17 goals of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Agricultural carbon sequestration, as if it is very important for small farmers to participate in global climate action, but small farmers lack resources, including finance, knowledge and experience, it is not easy to record, declare their working logs, so that the evidence of greenhouse gas emission reduction certification is difficult to be demonstrated. 

The Project Developer, the Eco-Affinity Inc., specially offers a set of smart phone applications for small farmers to do carbon farming called “MiHuMISang” adopted from  greetings of indigenous Bunun Tribe.  

Since smart phone, social media applications are popular, as long as farmers have the experience of taking photos, checking-in, post photos to share.  It is easy for small farmers to record their carbon project activities through encryption technology, the authentic photo files bundle with time stamps and geotags spontaneously that cannot be adulterated once they are uploaded to the database to form systematic big data to help small farmers achieve certification quality assurance and quality control (product and process QA/QC), and except personal confidential information, all data will be made public on the Internet for public participation and witness.  VVB is also easy to trace back to verify project activities, increase the credibility of certification, and preventing carbon leakage, double counting loopholes, and produce high-quality VERs.

This will not only apply to Taiwan, but also to small farmers around the world in the future, to promote more farmers and consumers to participate in climate action and achieve the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

The project provides access to clean drinking water for rural households and directly replaces non-renewable biomass (fuelwood) burning at baseline that would have been otherwise used to boil water at baseline which is mainly sourced from the unimproved or unhealthy water sources under the baseline scenario. In line with the Gold Standard definition, an improved drinking-water source is one that by the nature of its construction and design adequately protects the source from outside contamination, in particular by faecal matter. The underlying assumption is that improved sources are more likely to supply safe drinking-water than unimproved sources.

In this regard, borehole and tube wells are considered as the project scenario under ‘Improved Water Sources’. This falls under the category of “Eligible community water supply technologies (CWS)” and thus the project creates direct impacts into the basic need of the rural lives through piped water into dwellings sourced from tubewell and/or borehole. Under the project activity, new boreholes and tubewells are being constructed as new water supply points for the households.

This revolutionary concentrate, rich in copper and precious metals enjoys a low environmental footprint by bypassing the traditional mining channels and instead tapping into the ever-growing e-waste urban mine.
 
Igneo has perfected a simple yet exceptionally effective recycling and recovery solution to transform and enhance the vast quantities of valuable e-waste that are currently left untreated, unrecycled, and often abandoned in landfill. The Igneo process employs a multi-stage model which fully captures the economic value held in e-waste:
* Sourcing of electronic waste from traders, collectors and OEMs and identifying valuable key PCB (printed circuit board) and other metal containing material;
* Crushing and shredding the e-waste into a normalized fraction for further processing and sampling;
* The resulting shredded material is automatically sampled and then analyzed at on-site lab to determine the valuable metals contents;
* Using automated mechanical separation technology, remove the iron and aluminum from the shredded fraction;
* The shredded material is heat-treated using a pyrolyzing multi-hearth furnace, which convert organic matter into a gas state while retaining all metals. The result is a    homogeneous concentrate containing copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum etc. (copper concentrate);
* The off gas generated from the pyrolysis process is processed through several stages of gas remediation, including a post combustion chamber resulting in the mitigation or complete elimination of all toxic pollutants including dioxins, NOx gases and halogens.
 
The proprietary Igneo process converts and upgrades e-waste into a concentrate which is higher in valuable recoverable metal content than most other traditional copper concentrates and for the most part free of organic matter, sulfur, and toxic materials which are harmful or cost prohibitive to the copper smelting and refining processes.

The Clean Energy LLC has wind farm a capacity of 49.6 MW and generate (net) 168.5 GWh of electricity per year.

On 25th June 2013, The Salkhit wind farm started commercial operation. The Salkhit wind farm generates renewable electricity using wind power resources and sells the generated output to the Central Energy System (CES, or the grid) on the basis of a power purchase agreement (PPA). In addition, the Salkhit wind farm also aims to lead renewable energy generation from wind in Mongolia, as the Salkhit wind farm was the first grid connected wind farm in Mongolia. The Salkhit wind farm generates greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by avoiding CO2 emissions from electricity generation by fossil fuel power plants that is supplied to Grid.

Thus, Salkhit wind farm installed capacity is 49.6 MW of renewable energy power generation and supplies to the Grid of 164 GWh of electricity generated from renewable energy annually.

A. Project scenario is the operation of 31 sets of wind turbines with a total capacity of 50MW which will supply an annual generation of 164GWh to grid and replace same amount of electricity generated by fossil fuel-fired power plants connected to grid. According to ACM0002 applied, the project is renewable electricity activity.
B. The baseline scenario of the project is the electricity supply of equal amount as the project from the grid. The baseline scenario of the project is the same as the scenario prior to the start of implementation of project activity.

The Project boundary included the project site and all power plants connected physically to the grid.

As the Grid is dominated by thermal power generation, the Salkhit wind farm activity is leading to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. The second crediting period for the proposed project is from 24/06/2020 to 23/06/2027 and estimated emission reduction is in the second crediting period are 1,332,835tCO2e. The average annual emission reduction is estimated by 190,405 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) for the 2nd crediting period.

Sustainable development
As the very first wind farm in Mongolia the Salkhit wind farm is greatly assisting the country in stimulating the commercialisation of grid-connected renewable energy technologies and markets. The Salkhit wind farm is helping to reduce GHG emissions versus the coal-dominated business-as-usual scenario. Furthermore, the Salkhit wind farm is improving air quality and local livelihoods and promote sustainable renewable energy industry development.
The specific goals of the project are to:
• generate electricity;
• help to stimulate the implementation of wind power in Mongolia;
• reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Mongolia compared to a business-as-usual scenario;
• create local employment opportunity during the assembly and installation of wind turbines, and for operation of the wind farm;
• reduce other pollutants resulting from the power generation industry, compared to a business-as-usual approach, such as SO2 and soot.",190405,ACM0002 Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources,Large Scale,Standalone,,0

The project will last 5 years and will be renewable twice, for a maximum period of 15 years.

The project's cookstove model is a metal-ceramic fireplace using wood. 

The benefits will be both environmental and social. On the social front, the project will create jobs, reduce smoke emissions including smoke inhalation diseases, and reduce the time spent cooking and collecting biomass because the project's cooking stove needs less biomass to function. From an environmental point of view, the project will reduce the impact on the forest by reducing wood collection and thus avoid carbon emissions.

The objective of this improved cookstove project is therefore to improve the health and well-being of households, mainly women and children in the project area, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions released by traditional cooking and water boiling activities. 
The owner of the project is APEDD, a Guinean NGO (Association of Women for Development) that promotes women's empowerment and environmental protection.

LPG has significantly less environmental impact than other available fuels due to its source, combustion byproducts and yield. LPG is safer to transport and use and is precisely controllable by end-users – with known and consistent properties and minimal emissions of toxic byproducts. LPG does not emit soot (black carbon), smoke or dangerous fumes. The use of LPG stoves will be much more efficient than what is currently being used for cooking, thus requiring much fewer BTUs of fuel per meal. The result will be substantial reductions in both greenhouse gas and non-GHG pollution.

PayGo’s approach will be to use a Cylinder Smart Meter (CSM) system that enables a “pay as you go” service. The CSM contains a low-pressure LPG regulator, metering capabilities and a communications system. The product affixes to existing cylinder valves and enables customers to make small payments for LPG via the customer’s mobile money account.

There is significant dependence on polluting traditional chullahs (wood stoves) for cooking in rural and semi-urban households in the country. Household pollution can cause diseases and women are particularly affected due to their direct exposure to cooking fires and involvement in daily cooking. Combustion of the non-renewable fuels and release of greenhouse gas emissions in the environment adds to global warming problem. 

The Proposed Program of Activities (PoA), comprising of various Voluntary Project Activities (VPAs), will be addressing this problem by providing access to improved cooking solutions. This is a voluntary initiative by Tata Communications Limited.  Tata Communications will be collaborating with local implementation partners to provide improved cooking solutions for marginalized households living in rural and semi-urban areas in India. TATA Communications will act as the Coordinating and Managing Entity (CME) for the program.

180,11815,Electric Cooking Program by ATEC,ClimateCare Limited,Listed,"13,3,7,8,1",Energy Efficiency - Domestic,Cambodia,"The proposed Program of Activities (Electric Cooking Program by ATEC) has been
developed by ATEC Australia-International Pty Ltd (ATEC*) with the purpose of replacing the use of highly polluting non-renewable and fossil fuels used for cooking by households within the project target areas. This will be achieved through the distribution and installation of ATEC PAYGO enabled eCook induction cookstoves. ATEC’s patented electric cookstove (eCook) is the world’s first Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) induction stove which is ATEC’s flagship product that brings 27 months ranged PAYGO facility, Global System for Mobile (GSM) Communications and Internet of Things (IoT) functionality that makes mobile money payments easy for unbanked and underserved populations. 
The primary target are end-users who cook using polluting fuels in inefficient stoves in the baseline, yet are already connected to the grid. The use of electricity for cooking using highly efficient cooking appliances is expected to provide an affordable, convenient, and safe cooking solution to end-users. The program will also contribute towards sustainable development goals key among them being SDG 1,3,7 and 13. The first project activities are being implemented in Bangladesh and Cambodia.
The specific description of the Program of Activity is as follows:
a)	The Program of Activities (PoA) entails the distribution of an e-cooking solution among households especially those using biomass for cooking yet are connected to the grid. 
b)	The PoA is being developed and implemented by ATEC*, who will have the formal responsibility of coordinating the PoA and the included VPAs.
c)	ATEC* will work with local project implementers who will provide support in the management of the VPAs in respective countries. 
d)	The PoA is a voluntary action by the project developer and will apply the Methodology for Metered & Measured Energy Cooking Devices in the calculation of emission reductions. 
The project will have social, economic, and environmental benefits and impacts across the following multiple areas:
•	Improved health: Using e-cooking solutions reduces the use of polluting fuels such as firewood, charcoal, and kerosene which disproportionately impacts women and children due to smoke and other household in-door air polluters causing respiratory illnesses. E-cooking provides a clean, safe and reliable cooking solution that will lead to significant improvement in indoor air quality in beneficiary households (SDG 3).
•	Environment & Climate Change: using traditional inefficient biomass stoves consumes a lot of fuel and emits GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Using electricity for cooking will reduce CO2 and black carbon emissions hence reducing the impacts of climate change (SDG 13).
•	Gender equality and empowerment of women: Cooking on traditional inefficient biomass stoves (firewood and charcoal) consumes a lot of fuel leading to the constant need to source the fuel. Consequently, fuel collection is usually done by women and girls, and this requires more time and effort which takes away their productive hours. The e-cooking technology being promoted by the project developer is efficient and saves on households’ time since there is no need for collecting wood, and the cooking time is shortened. This leads to productive use of time at home, especially for women who can venture into other income-generating activities and improve the quality of study time for children (SDG 4 & 5).
•	Money and Time savings: Most families using biomass fuels and kerosene for cooking spend a significant portion of their time and income on fuel collection and purchase. As fuel becomes scarce, expenditure on fuel becomes more significant due to the increase in fuel prices and this leads to more household income being spent on meeting the household energy needs. ATEC seeks to target households who are connected to the grid but using biomass and kerosene for cooking, in the distribution of the units. Using the technology will provide meaningful time and money savings for these end-users (SDG 1).
•	Affordable and Clean Energy: Affordable clean energy for cooking is an essential form of energy access which will be achieved through the e-cooking technology being promoted by the program (SDG 7).
•	Job creation: The program will create employment opportunities for many people in different phases of the program. These are expected to benefit locals and especially the youths who will be employed as part of sales and service teams, and the overall management of the program (SDG 8).

233,11721,The OASIS Box Sustainable Project ,BONDH-E-SHAMS,Listed,13,Other,Pakistan," The objective of this project is to deliver and implement 150 OASIS Box units to address severe water-scarcity and consumption of contaminated water in rural communities in Nowshera, Pakistan. The OASIS Box is an all-in-one, solar-powered water filtration and storage unit, which offers up to 10,000 liters of 99.9999% contamination free water daily. See section A.3 for detailed breakdown of technology. Each OASIS Box will bring clean water to 100 households. Based on the average no. of people per household at 5, overall, this project has the capacity to bring clean water to up to 75,000 individuals in Nowshera. The project will be implemented in phases beginning with Phase 1: 10 OASIS Box deployments.  
Households in rural communities have limited resource to purify water, often resulting in consumption of dirty water. By and large, these communities often find themselves in a cycle of chronic illness which particularly impacts children and often leads to fatalities. In Pakistan alone, an estimated 53,000 children die annually from water-borne related disease (UNICEF). In addition, Pakistan still has strides to make in implementing green technology in the WASH sector. In the absence of national action, communities are extremely self-reliant and rely on conventional methods such as burning fuelwood to purify water. In the baseline scenario (per 100 households) an estimated following VERs are emitted from burning fuelwoods to purify water:  
330 ton CO2, 17.5 ton CH4 and 17.5 ton N2O
By deploying our units as a safe and sustainable alternative, project emissions are assumed to be zero given that our technology only utilizes solar energy, without access to a backup generator or connection to an electrical grid. In the project scenario, each unit is estimated to offset 360 VERs.

This project installs and runs 33 wind turbines with a single unit capacity of 1,500kW, with a total installed capacity of 49.5MW. After the project runs normally, it can provide on-grid power to the North China Power Grid every year. The capacity is 101,480MWh, which is equivalent to the annual operating hours of 2,050.1 hours. Without this project, the electricity generated will be provided by the North China Power Grid, which is also the baseline scenario of this project. The North China Power Grid is dominated by thermal power. The zero-emission wind power of this project will effectively replace part of the electricity produced by fossil fuel power plants in the North China Power Grid, avoiding CO2 emissions during the power generation process corresponding to the replaced power, thereby realizing greenhouse gas emission reduction. It is estimated that this project can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 83,913 tCO2e each year.",83913,ACM0002 Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources,Large Scale,Standalone,,0

In the rural areas in India, the predominant means of cooking are traditional cook stoves that use woody biomass as fuel. The smoke and fumes from these traditional inefficient stoves contribute heavily to indoor air pollution, which overall claim approximately 400,000 lives per year in India . In rural areas of India, households are either not connected to the grid or in households even with grid connectivity, there are frequent power outages and low voltage so rural households use kerosene for indoor lighting, which also contributes to indoor air pollution and GHG emissions. 

The proposed small-scale project activity involves marketing, distributing, and financing improved cookstove and solar lighting systems, for low-income households and microentrepreneurs in India. Future sales of solar lighting systems may happen in any state but within the geographic boundary of the PoA i.e. the country of India. However, it will be ensured at all times that the threshold for SSC projects is not exceeded and the PoA eligibility criteria are met.

These products provide clean energy for cooking and renewable energy for lighting. The cookstoves distributed under the VPA replaces traditional cookstoves thereby reducing the amount of fuelwood used for cooking in the baseline by households and thus reducing GHG emissions corresponding to the fuelwood saving by the project activity.

491,11331,Circle Gas LPG Smart Meter Program in Kenya,ClimateCare Limited,Gold Standard Certified Design,"13,5,3,7,8",Energy Efficiency - Domestic,Kenya,"The proposed project activity (Circle Gas LPG Smart Meter Program in Kenya) has been developed by Circle Gas with the purpose of reducing the high demand for wood, charcoal and kerosene predominantly used for cooking by households within the target areas. This will be achieved through distribution and installation of LPG units that are fitted with a smart meter to track and monitor LPG usage by the end-users. The project adopts a Pay as You Go (PAYG) approach to accelerate access to LPG by the end-users. The project acitivity also aims to contribute towards sustainable development goals. The specific description of the project activity is as follows:
a)	The project entails distribution and installation of Pay as You Go LPG units that are made distinct by the unique smart meter developed by Circle Gas.
b)	The project developer is Circle Gas, who will have the formal responsibility of the Project activity.
c)	The VPA implementor for this project activity is M-Gas Kenya, and will be directly responsible for maintaining the sales database, collecting baseline information, and co-ordinating the annual monitoring process. 
d)	The project activity is a voluntary action by the project developer. 
e)	The goal of the project is to accelerate access to LPG especially among low-income households which will significantly reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with use of traditionally unsustainable fuels such as wood, charcoal, and kerosene.

The aim of the project activity is to replace traditional biomass (fuelwood and charcoal), and kerosene cookstoves used in the baseline, with LPG units which will deliver impacts across the following multiple areas:
•	Improved health: Using LPG reduces the use of dirty fuels such as firewood, charcoal and kerosene which disproportionately impacts on women and children due to smoke and other household air polluters causing respiratory illnesses. Household Air Pollution (HAP) is one of the largest health risk factors for mortality in Kenya with about 21,560 deaths attributed to HAP annually . Clean burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), although a fossil fuel, emits low levels of BC and minimal PM2.5 concentrations, typically meeting WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline levels for health (SDG 3).  
•	Environment & Climate Change: using traditional inefficient biomass and kerosene stoves consumes more fuel and emits GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Clean burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), although a fossil fuel, emits low levels of black carbon and minimal PM2.5 concentrations, typically meeting WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline levels for health.Using LPG reduces CO2 and black carbon emissions hence reducing the impacts of climate change (SDG 13).
•	Gender equality and empowerment of women: Cooking on traditional biomass inefficient stoves (firewood and charcoal) consumes a lot of fuel leading to constant need to source the fuel. Consequently, fuel collection is usually done by women and girls, and this requires more time and effort which takes away their productive hours. The project technology is efficient and saves on households’ time since there is no need for collecting wood and cooking time is shortened. This leads to improved use of time at home especially for women who can venture in other income generating activities and give children more time for study (SDG 4 & 5).
•	Money and Time savings: Families spend a significant portion of their time and income on fuel collection and purchase. As fuel becomes scarce, expenditure on fuel becomes more significant due to the increase in fuel prices and this leads to more household income being spent on meeting the household energy provision. The Circle Gas target market is the urban low-income population. Using the technology provides meaningful savings for customers while creating thousands of high-quality jobs (SDG 1).
•	Affordable and Clean Energy: Affordable energy for cooking is an essential form of energy access which will be achieved through implementation of this programme (SDG 7).
•	Job creation: the project will create employment to many people especially the youths who will be employed as field sales and service teams, and the overall management of the programme (SDG 8). 

The project boundary for the VPA is the Republic of Kenya. 
The legal ownership of the products generated belongs to Circle Gas. The end-users sign a carbon rights waiver form, at the time of installation of the Circle Gas LPG unit, which transfers the carbon rights to Circle Gas.

The household biogas plants utilize cattle dung in the digester for the production of biogas which is burnt in gas stoves for household cookings. This leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing conventionally used non-renewable biomass with renewable biogas. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters can be used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil fertility in rural areas.

Additionally, this will also led to an increase in household income levels especially for female headed households and a significant reduction in health related disease affecting women. Women and the girl-child in rural communities are subjected to long hours in the bush fetching firewood for cooking and heating and in most cases, they have to walk long distances. The solar cooker project will help reduce indiscriminate cutting of trees for fuel wood for cooking and heating. The project has taken an integrated approach encompassing components such as reforestation. The integration model will help communities in the project area to have access to clean energy, promote sustainable forestry management, food security and climate resilient communities. This model will help promote access to renewable energy technologies as enshrined in the National Policy on Climate Change (2016).

The African Stove Company Ltd. (TASC) is the coordinating/managing entity (CME) of the PoA and is the sole implementer of the VPA. TASC’s mission is financing and developing high-impact climate mitigation projects. 
 
The VPA is an activity that was originally anticipated to be included as a CPA under a CDM PoA (6864: Fuel Efficient Stoves in Africa ) and is now transitioning from the CDM to the Gold Standard under the PoA GS11009: TASC Clean Cooking PoA. The VPA is therefore retroactive in nature, as the first ICS was distributed in Zambia on 26th August 2020. 

The VPA is implemented in communities Zambia where woodfuel is the primary source of energy for cooking and open, 3-stone fires are commonplace. 

The project ICS combust biomass fuels more efficiently, reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and particulate emissions (PM), thus improving the indoor air quality in project households. Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the 3-stone fires, the ICS reduce the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs.

In the absence of the proposed VPA, inefficient 3-stone fires are used for cooking and their replacement with project ICS reduces non-renewable biomass fuel consumption, saving greenhouse gas emissions.

At the time of VPA inclusion, there are 45,000 ICS planned for distribution under the VPA, of which c. 35,000 have been distributed and entered into the monitoring database. It is anticipated that the remaining ICS will be distributed by April 2021.",431949,GS TPDDTEC v3.1,Large Scale,VPA,11009.0,0

664,11139,Access to Improved Cooking Solutions Programme,ClimateCare Limited,Gold Standard Certified Design,"13,5,8,1",Energy Efficiency - Domestic,India,"The purpose of this program is threefold; 1) to reduce wood fuel (firewood and charcoal) consumption by distributing ICSs to households, 2) to provide a healthy environment and sustainable development by reducing air pollutant emission and deforestation and 3) to reduce emissions associated with cooking.
The PoA aims to replace traditional stoves with high efficient cooking devices, which would deliver impact across multiple areas.
Cooking on inefficient cooking devices using biomass, is a global problem affecting health, productivity and the environment. A large part of the PoA boundary population cannot use modern fuels such as electricity or cooking gas on account of access, affordability and availability.  
Inefficient cooking devices consume significant amounts of fuel and emit dangerous smoke on account of their incomplete and inefficient combustion. The smoke emitted by traditional stoves is known to be one of the biggest health risks faced by women and children due to the presence of particulates.
For this reason, this proposed PoA aims at reducing the wood fuel consumption of inefficient cooking devices by distributing improved cook devices which reduce fuel consumption. To reduce deforestation and the emission of greenhouse gas within the PoA boundary, cooking devices being distributed will lead to use of less wood fuel or substitute it.
The PoA proposes to develop and commercialise the carbon assets from the distribution of various cooking devices (improved cook stoves, ethanol stoves, electric cookers, metered LPG, solar cookers amongst others) to replace baseline inefficient stoves.  The PoA will structured in away such that it can leverage on investor funding and carbon finance to support (subsidy) production and distribution. The investor funds would be supplemented with Carbon funds which will create a revolving fund to help in payment for the cooking devices and provide a loan facility to help more uptake of the cooking devices.",0,GS TPDDTEC V4.0: REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM COOKING AND HEATING – TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES TO DISPLACE DECENTRALIZED THERMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION,Small Scale,POA,,0

Now, Fair Climate Fund (FCF), a Dutch organization based in Utrecht, The Netherlands in an agreement with tiipaalga association along with local communities/federation is developing 5 grouped VPAs (Voluntary Project Activities) that will cover the municipalities of Pô, Tiébélé and Gniaro in the Province of Nahouri and will seek inclusion under the registered gold standard PoA and later certify under Fairtrade Climate Standard. This VPA, being part of the 5 grouped VPAs, will be developed to implement clean, safe and energy efficient cooking stoves which will consume less firewood and reduce smoke in the cooking area. The project promotes the implementation improved cook stove which is a mud made 3 stones efficient woodstove “F3PA”. The improved cook stoves will replace traditional cooking stoves, which utilize firewood and charcoal. With this approach, the 5 VPAs will reach out to more than 10,000 households in the Province of Nahouri in Burkina Faso. This project seeks to increase access of rural communities to improved cook stoves by implementing F3PA mud stoves and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Burkina Faso. The improved cook stoves or F3PA mud stoves will be made of a mixture of clay mud, straw, dung of a donkey or cow and water. The stove will be constructed by locally available, inexpensive materials and its size will be customized as per the size of corresponding family. The project implementation will be done by imparting training to the local women in the rural areas. The technical and operational skill will be developed at local level which provides knowledge at household level on how to use and maintain the improved cook stoves. The implementation also includes component of education on hygienic usage and on the threat of climate change and health hazards related to the old cooking system and inform on the health and environmental benefits of using such efficient cook stoves. The proposed improved cook stove technology will create a positive impact on the environment and eligible for generating Gold Standard certified emission reduction units which will be later certified under Fairtrade Climate Standard.

The project ICS combust biomass fuels more efficiently, reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate matter (PM) emissions, improving indoor air quality in project households/SMEs. Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the traditional/baseline stoves, the ICS reduce the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs. 
In the absence of the proposed PoA, inefficient traditional / 3-stone fires /charcoal pots would have been used for cooking. Thus, replacement of the baseline inefficient stoves with project ICS shall reduce non-renewable biomass fuel consumption and hence equivalent amount of GHG emissions.

The Program addresses two drivers for inhouse pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuel-based lamp devices with solar energy technology as well as inefficient stoves with more energy efficient cook stoves. These will be distributed to households and small holders in the project region, thereby helping to reduce fuel costs and risks for diseases in the respiratory systems and the eyes. Further tens of millions of schoolchildren in Africa cannot study after dark because they live without electricity. After school, children often help their families with household chores and agricultural tasks and once they turn their attention to homework, their neighbourhoods and villages are in almost complete darkness. By the distribution of solar lamps to school children this program will contribute to expanding study hours to night-time and reduces costs of unhealthy sources of light. As the project targets the improvement of livelihood in households this project targets as well the traditional cooking methods which are often inefficient, dangerous, and harmful to the environment. The Programme aims at providing especially women with improved stoves that improve health, safe time, firewood, and money. The stoves aim at reducing 50% of the timber used so less time is spent in gathering firewood, a task traditionally carried out by children and women that takes up to 20 hours a week. The new stove also emits less smoke and will result in less eye and respiratory diseases It is the aim of the program to support local developers of clean cook stoves in order to support their development and support technology that is reflecting the needs and was approved by local communities. The project scope is including, but not limited to the distribution of solar lamps for school kids, household solar PV applications, solar water pumps, and clean cookstove technologies.

of greenhouse gas emissions and the improvement of the socio-economic situation of
households in East African countries, especially in Ethiopia. The Program addresses two
drivers for inhouse pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuel-based
lamp devices with solar energy technology as well as inefficient stoves with more energy
efficient cook stoves. These will be distributed to households and small holders in the
project region, thereby helping to reduce fuel costs and risks for diseases in the
respiratory systems and the eyes. Further tens of millions of schoolchildren in Africa
cannot study after dark because they live without electricity. After school, children often
help their families with household chores and agricultural tasks and once they turn their
attention to homework, their neighbourhoods and villages are in almost complete
darkness. By the distribution of solar lamps to school children this program will contribute
to expanding study hours to night-time and reduces costs of unhealthy sources of light.
As the project targets the improvement of livelihood in households this project targets as
well the traditional cooking methods which are often inefficient, dangerous, and harmful
to the environment. The Programme aims at providing especially women with improved
stoves that improve health, safe time, firewood, and money. The stoves aim at reducing
50% of the timber used so less time is spent in gathering firewood, a task traditionally
carried out by children and women that takes up to 20 hours a week. The new stove also
emits less smoke and will result in less eye and respiratory diseases It is the aim of the
program to support local developers of clean cook stoves in order to support their
development and support technology that is reflecting the needs and was approved by
local communities.
The project scope is including, but not limited to the distribution of solar lamps for school
kids, household solar PV applications, solar water pumps, and clean cookstove
technologies.",0,AMS-I.A. Electricity generation by the user,Micro scale,POA,,0

The secondary aluminum raw materials put on the market by AS METAL correspond to the requirements of the European Industrial Standards (Recyclable materials EN 13920 1-16:2003 Aluminum and aluminum alloys. Scrap.); the American Standards INSTITUTE OF SCRAP RECYCLING INDUSTRIES INC, as well as to the Directives and the European Environmental Regulations (Regulation 333/2011 establishing the conditions under which certain aluminum and iron wastes are no longer considered as waste). 
The technologies used by AS METAL COM SRL allow us to recover and separate metal waste with a fraction mass mainly of aluminum resulting from the processing of secondary aluminum raw materials and other ferrous and non-ferrous metal substances which in turn are put on the market in accordance with the industry standards that govern them. Our technological processes guarantee a high recovery efficiency not only through the reported quantities but especially through their quality. 

The output capacity of the aluminum recycling plant is given by the types of processed waste and is between 49.000 up to 77.500 tons/year. 
The project activity is located on the industrial platform of AS METAL of 35,000 sqm. in the southern part of Bucharest, capital of Romania.

The main goal of the project is the reduction of CO2 emissions through aluminum recycling, displacing the primary aluminum production from raw materials (mined minerals, bauxite). In the case of primary aluminum production from raw materials, the process has a much greater consumption of energy and therefor a much higher environmental impact regarding CO2 emissions.

The activity of the project is a model for other similar aluminum recycling facilities in Romania and Eastern Europe, which deliver sustainable development. Furthermore, the project is in line with specific UN requirements and with the European circular economy (aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources) directives.

The project is located at Jaisalmer district in the state of Rajasthan. The project will generate energy through renewable source i.e. wind. The kinetic energy of wind is converted into mechanical energy and subsequently into electrical energy. Kinetic energy which is carried by wind when passes through the blades of the WTG, is converted to mechanical energy which rotates the connected generator and which in turn produces the electricity. The electricity thus produced will be displacing the grid electricity which would have been otherwise generated through sources dominated by fossil fuel based power plants. The project activity thereby reduces the emission of green house gases which would have been generated from such fossil fuel based power plants. The electricity generation from the project activity will contribute to GHG reductions estimated at 11,568 t CO2e annually, while 115,680 t CO2e over period of 10 years. ",11435,AMS-I.D.

The PoA is a voluntary action with a goal of providing solutions that will reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with the use of non-renewable fuel from cooking at household levels. The use of non-renewable fuel such as wood and charcoal for cooking, leads to the emission of greenhouses gases, deforestation, and poor indoor climate. The programme will use several different technologies to reach this goal.  The solutions are based on two concepts that fall under the same CDM methodology: 	 
1.	Reduce the need for boiling water for drinking and thus reduce the need for non-renewable fuel for boiling water. This is achieved by providing clean and safe drinking water to participating households. The purified water is provided either through
a.	Water purification system provided at the household level or b.	Community-based water purification system where the households will get the purified water at water stations.  
 2. Provide clean renewable fuel for cooking and thus eliminate the need for non-renewable fuel consumption for cooking. This is done by providing highly efficient stoves that are using renewable fuel. The renewable fuel can either be:  
c.	Denatured alcohol or 
d.	Biogas.  
However, for this project, the specific focus is on the provision of clean renewable fuel for cooking and this will entail the distribution of denatured alcohol (ethanol) stoves in Kenya. 
The project has been registered with the UNFCCC, the reference number 7359.  The POA covers 19 African countries but for this Sub-POA, the host country is Kenya.

The Standard Practice is to keep the rice fields constantly flooded which results in prevalence of anaerobic soil bacteria. These produce Methane which is a greenhouse gas which makes rice cultivation into one of the factors with the highest short term potential to influence global heating.If the rice fields are not flooded constantly and the surface of the fields are allowed to fall dry from time to time, the emittance of Greenhouse Gases, especially Methane will be reduced considerably.

Building on a track record of implementing wind energy projects in Europe and the United States, UPC has ongoing wind project development activities in Europe, North Africa, China, and the Philippines .The proposed project is to be located in the Tangier-Tetouan Region, Fahs Anjra Province, Morocco. 40 wind turbines with a nominal unit capacity of 3 MW will be installed, providing a total capacity of 120 MW. The net expected electricity generation is estimated at 296,100 MWh/year . The Load Factor (Net Capacity Factor) is 28.17% or 2467.69 full load hours annually. The wind farm production will be wheeled through the national electricity grid, for the use of UPC Renewables’ clients .The proposed project is developed in the context of the new regulatory framework in Morocco (the Law 13.09). This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the country’s energy dependence vis-à-vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs.

The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de Leña en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution.",42222,AMS-II.G.

The Project “Greentech’s Emissions Reductions from PET Recycling, Romania"", developed by Greentech – a member company of Green Group,  is the first project in Europe to apply PET waste frameworks through PET waste recycling, proactively reducing greenhouse gases emissions (GHGs) that would be otherwise required for the production of plastic products made of virgin inputs and accelerating progress towards many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s).
The total GHG emission reductions for the 10 years crediting period (2016-2025) are estimated at 453,800 t CO2. The estimated annual average GHG emissions reduction is 45,380 t CO2/year.
Furthermore, the project is in line with specific UN requirements because it contributes to local environmental sustainability, since recycling instead of using material from virgin inputs decreases the overall energy use, GHGs and environmental burden caused by natural resources extraction.
At the same time, PET waste recycling reduces the amount of waste to be disposed in the landfill. The project also contributes towards better working conditions and better revenue distribution to improve local and regional economic development, increases employment opportunities in the area; it contributes to the development of new technologies, to regional integration and connection with other sectors, and to a large extent to the local municipalities’ funds for social insurance, such as health and pension funds, and to local and social community development.",45380,AMS-III.AJ.

The applied technology is a ceramic water filter that produces water of safe drinking water quality which is further described in section A.5 below.Prior to the implementation of the proposed project, in the proposed project boundary there is limited access to clean drinking water. Lack of ready access to a water source also limit the quantity of suitable drinking water that is available to a household. Even if the water is obtained from an improved source, water that must be fetched from a source that is not readily accessible to the household and may be contaminated during transport or storage . Nationally, boiling water prior to drinking is the most common treatment method (70.1 percent of total population). The percentage of urban people and rural people boiling water is 60.0 percent and 80.1 percent, respectively . The baseline scenario is the continuation of current practice, thus identical to the existing scenario prior to the implementation of the proposed project.Under the project scenario, the proposed project will reduce GHG emissions by replacing the use of non-renewable biomass or fossil fuel to boil water to purify the water for drinking purposes. This purification method is energy intensive, creates indoor air pollution that is damaging to health, and emits significant GHG. Thus, the project activity contributes to the reduction in the GHG gas emissions associated to fossil fuel combustion for obtaining safe drinking water (SDW) as per conventional methods of water purification and also provides access to SDW to the consumers at an affordable price.

The proposed project is located in the Southern Power Region and has been conceived for harnessing the power potential of left flank of the branch anicut in the Godavari River in Khammam District. This project involves the installation of six Horizontal Pit type full Kaplan turbines & generating units of 4 MW each to generate 24MW of power utilizing a rated head of 4.8m and a design discharge of 601.02m3 (Please refer to section A.4.3 for further technical details). 
The project activity is a Greenfield project planned on the Godavari River. Thus, the scenario existing prior to the implementation of this project activity would be to allow the potential energy in the flowing river to go untapped. In the absence of the project activity, any existing power demand in the region would be met by the continued operation of fossil fuel based power plants in the grid. Hydropower is a clean, renewable source of energy and does not contribute to air or water pollution or the emissions of greenhouse gases. The water after powering the turbines will be discharged back into the Godavari River through a tailrace canal, located within the river course close to the left bank open channel. 
The objective of the proposed project is to generate power from harnessing the water to meet the ever increasing demand for electricity in the Southern region of India. The generated power will be exported to the Southern regional grid via the sub-station at Bhadrachalam. The project is expected to export 100,300 MWh of energy per year to the grid. However, the project is commissioned and it is found that the generation in a year reached high is about 45801 MWh owing to various reasons. Hydro power plants are considered to be zero emission power sources. The project activity will displace the fossil fuel fired power generation from the grid and hence contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gases.
 The baseline scenario relates to the export of electricity to the grid by the operation of grid connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources.

Most families in the area cook with traditional three stone fires which consume large amounts of firewood. This means that a lot of time is spent for the firewood collection. The firewood collection is also causing deforestation and land degradation. Firewood combustion is moreover a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible for climate change. In addition to the environmental consequences, there are serious health implications related with the inefficient cooking methods through the exposure on the smoke and other emissions. The project will be attempting to address these issues by distributing energy efficient cookstoves at a subsided rate to households.

The project aims to improve upon the traditional cooking methods used at more than 500 institutions, benefiting upwards of half a million individuals, reducing approximately 50,000  tons of CO2 emissions per annum, and approximately 325,000 tons of CO2 emissions over the course of the 7-year crediting period.The IICS may be of different models and/or different sizes and will consume firewood. The different models and/or different sizes of IICS are either manufactured by the local stove manufacturer and project participant (PP) Virunga Engineering Works (u) Limited (VEW) or purchased from other manufacturers. As schools and institutions move up in the energy ladder, and fuel briquettes made of agricultural residues become available in Uganda, these IICS could also be used with such fuel briquettes in the future. In the case that a school/institution/IICS will use briquettes made of renewable biomass (agricultural residues and/or firewood from renewable plantations), the PP will ensure that no emission reduction credits will be claimed from the fuel switch from non-renewable to renewable biomass but only from the fuel savings resulting from the introduction of the IICS. The IICS are both portable as well as fixed built-in types, serving schools and other institutional users like prisons, plantation estates and hospitals. These IICS are more efficient in transferring heat to the saucepans, and as such, IICS require less biomass fuel to perform an equivalent cooking task when compared to the baseline technology. This increase in efficiency  translates directly to the  large scale fuel savings over the traditional stoves currently in use. By reducing fuel consumption, the project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the use of biomass fuels. This reduction in fuel consumption is estimated and corresponding CO2 emission reductions are calculated from these savings. The project activity shall initially deploy the VEW rocket stove IICS of 300 liters saucepan capacity to schools and institutions, but may distribute other saucepan capacities and/or models of IICS that meet the minimum thermal efficiency requirement of 20% later on. The different IICS sizes are conditioned by the saucepan capacity and range from 30 liters and up to 450 liters.",47745,AMS-II.G.

The working mechanism of heat retaining cooking is simple. The pot containing the food is brought to the boiling point. The temperature accumulated by the pot and its contents at the boiling point is enough to continue and end the cooking process in an insulated environment. The initial type of HRC technology that will be used is the “Wonder Cooker” (WC). Wonder Cookers are bags made of cotton fabric that establish the insulated environment through the use of small polystyrene beads sewn into compartments of the bag.

Building on a track record of implementing wind energy projects in Europe and the United States, UPC has ongoing wind project development activities in Europe, North Africa, China, and the Philippines .The proposed project is to be located in the Tangier-Tetouan Region, Fahs Anjra Province, Morocco. 40 wind turbines with a nominal unit capacity of 3 MW will be installed, providing a total capacity of 120 MW. The net expected electricity generation is estimated at 296,100 MWh/year . The Load Factor (Net Capacity Factor) is 28.17% or 2467.69 full load hours annually. The wind farm production will be wheeled through the national electricity grid, for the use of UPC Renewables’ clients .The proposed project is developed in the context of the new regulatory framework in Morocco (the Law 13.09). This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the country’s energy dependence vis-à-vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs. As such, the project activity is expected to contribute to the development of wind energy in Morocco and hence to help achieve the objectives of Morocco’s national strategy for renewable energy development. Generally speaking, the project’s contribution to Morocco’s sustainable development can be summarized by the following benefits:•Diversification of the national supply of energy;•Project in line with the Moroccan government’s objectives to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The diversification of energy sources for electricity production is one of the objectives of the new Moroccan energy strategy with an objective of 20% of renewable energy capacity in the nation’s electricity production in 2012 and a targeted development of 2,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2020 .•Local development of renewable energy usage;•Reduction of the country’s imports in hard currency by the use of wind power instead of electricity mainly currently produced from imported coal, oil products and natural gas;•Reduction of national GHG emissions in accordance with the objectives of the UNFCCC ;•Contribution to the development of national and foreign investments in the energy sector;•Clean technology transfer and local capacity building in wind electricity generation and optimal use of wind energy in a heavy industry ;•Increases local employment opportunities during the construction phase and subsequently for the project’s operation phase.

The energy – efficient stoves in this VPA also known as improved cook stoves (ICS), are designed by a team of experts, scientists and engineers at Envirofit.In the absence of project activity, the traditional inefficient cook stoves, commonly referred to as chulhas, would have been used for cooking – producing substantial GHG emissions due to burning of non renewable biomass. A large portion of the rural population in India is dependent on traditional biomass chulhas. The most commonly used chulhas are made of mud/clay fixed in a kitchen corner with an opening near the floor for fuel and one or two openings on top to place pots. The use of solid biomass fuels (eg. fuel wood) in these inefficient traditional chulhas – while meeting domestic household needs - releases large amounts of particulate matter into the air, thus causing Indoor Air Pollution .  The programme, by replacing traditional chulhas, solves the Indoor Air Pollution problem by deploying cleaner and greener ICS in addition to reducing GHG emissions.",22271,AMS-II.G.

As a result we planned to make use of the Clean Development Mechanism Gold Standard (GS) certification and project in order to promote improved cook stoves (SAVE 80), in the area of operation of SMARTD, i.e. in the entire district of Qacha’s Nek and in the rural areas of Quthing and Mohale’s Hoek which are Seforong in the Quthing district, Hloahloeng, Sebaretlane, Qabanyane and Qabane in the Mohale’s Hoek district. The improved cook stove can be used by households, which are using mainly fuel wood as their source of fuel. The SAVE 80, stove set promoted by SMARTD contains a stainless steel stove, three cooking pots with lids and a heat retaining container/wonder cooker. This stove uses only small brittle sticks/twigs of wood to cook or boil water. It saves up to 80% of fuel wood compared to ordinary open fire way of cooking. This means that if you would need 1.5kg of wood to boil 6litres of water on an open fire, with SAVE 80 you would only need 0.3kg.The stove is suitable for cooking, frying and water heating. After reaching boiling point, food can be transferred to the wonder cooker where it will continue to simmer until it is well cooked. This further reduces wood consumption. Besides preventing greenhouse gas emissions, the objectives of the planned CDM Gold Standard programs are:•To reduce wood consumption to a sustainable level so as to allow natural recovery of forests and/or reforestation to take place.•To reduce soil erosion and protect the environment.•To reduce indoor air pollution wood smoke and avoid its harmful health consequences.•To reduce time for wood collection for households.•To contribute to the prevention of wood resources so as to avoid inter-communal conflicts over resources.•To empower participating women groups in villages by including them in project activities.•To reduce vulnerability of households falling into poverty through decreasing fuel wood scarcity.Thanks to the income that will be generated through certification of the project under the Gold Standard, the high quality improved cook stoves can be sold at a reduced price to make them affordable to the average households.

2180,4424,African Cookstoves and Water Programme PoA,Likano Project Development GmbH,Gold Standard Certified Design,"13,15,3",Energy Efficiency - Domestic,Rwanda,"Biomass, principally firewood and charcoal, holds huge importance in Rwanda, accounting for a significant proportion of energy consumption. Biomass is often the predominant source of energy for cooking and water boiling, especially in rural areas. Cooking is generally carried out on thermally inefficient traditional devices and produces large amounts of smoke and indoor air pollution. The distribution of efficient cook stoves in this Programme will significantly reduce fuel consumption, resulting in an improved living environment for recipients and reduced pressure on local forests, with a reduction in fuel being burnt annually as a result of the project. By reducing fuel consumption, CO2 emissions from combustion of non-renewable biomass will be correspondingly reduced. In addition more than 1 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water and a high percentage these boil their water to purify it for consumption, taking significant amounts of fuel and time. In addition to distributing improved cook stoves, this PoA will also introduce safe water technologies such as boreholes. Clean water technologies avoid the need for water to be treated by boiling, equating to a reduction in CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass. Boreholes will either be newly installed or repaired and returned to working order but in all cases will be maintained throughout the project life time. Using the concept of suppressed demand, project developers can also obtain credits by supplying clean water to poorer members of society that are not able to use biomass energy to treat their water (usually because they cannot afford it, or because the energy is otherwise unavailable to them). This means that the credits obtained are proportional to the amount of biomass that would have been combusted using traditional technology in order to provide clean water for users. This concept allows for beneficiaries who would otherwise not benefit from the project to be included and supplied with a safe water source.",0,GS TPDDTEC v 1.,Microscale,POA,,0

Its energy efficient stand-alone project activity registered with the Clean Development Mechanism and the Gold Standard is capable of bringing a cleaner, healthier and environmentally friendly technology to low-income individuals, especially women and children, by changing the traditional cooking practices used in schools in Uganda. Simoshi outsources institutional improved cook stoves (IICS) from the local manufacturer Ugastove and promotes and sells them to schools and institutions. The behavioural transformation Simoshi brings to schools through an effective management of change and subsequent support to the continuous use of the IICS enables both the participating schools and Simoshi to recycle a percentage of the stream of carbon credit returns, to further expand the number of schools that move up in the energy ladder.
Simoshi sells the IICS through payment schemes that include instalment modalities, allowing schools to comfortably pay back their debt throughout the school year, using the money saved from firewood NOT consumed to pay back for the acquired IICS. 
Simoshi's strong relationship of trust built with schools through monitoring, on-going staff training and free annual IICS maintenance, are the added on value and innovative project's pillars necessary for the behavioural transition to happen. IICS is a product that is prone to rapid deterioration if not maintained regularly. Nevertheless the annual free service provided to the IICS and the school is crucial in shaping future customer relations, product expectations and ultimately behavioural change. Schools face tremendous financial constrains and attention to the kitchen environment is the least of their priorities. Nevertheless, they play a crucial role in the school finances, the health impact for children and cooks, the deforestation impact and subsequent CO2 emissions",30072,AMS-II.G.

The power plant is expected to generate a net energy output of 27.638 GWh per year, estimated on the basis of long-term average wind speeds at the location. Electricity produced is sold to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the national electricity utility, through a dedicated transmission line. The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lanka’s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri.

Excess electricity is supplied to the grid.The main purpose of the project is to transform the existing low tech sludge treatment processat Kubratovo into a modern advanced treatment process matching the best sludge treatmentpractice available in Western Europe. This transformation has a major effect on the environmentthrough dramatically reducing the existing methane gas emissions at the plant while alsoreducing the volume of sludge (to as much as 50%) that needs to be transported, hencereducing GHG emissions from transportation as well (not included in GHG abatementcalculations).The overall objective of the project is to provide an environmentally friendly sludge treatmentprocess reducing methane and carbon dioxide emissions that – under a business-as-usualscenario – would have continued.Other objectives are:• replace the traditional sludge drying beds and landfill options with mesophilic digestion ofall primary and secondary sludge followed by mechanical dewatering in order to reduceGHG emissions;• effectively mitigate odour problems from the existing treatment of sludge and sludgeliquors through introduction of digestion;• production of fertiliser by mechanical dewatering of the digested stabilised sludge;• production of electricity from utilisation of the biogas in CHP gas engines therebyreducing GHG emissions from electricity production by the grid.The project delivers the following key results:• all primary and secondary sludge thickened and digested as per EU recommendationsand guidelines;• all biogas produced within the digestion process used for power and heat generation viaCHP gas engines thus reducing on-site electricity purchases from the national grid;reduction in on-site fossil fuel usage as all site-heating requirements will be met by theCHP gas engines;• all sludge is stabilised and pathogen free.Long term strategic reductions of GHG emissions include:• reduction in open release of CH4 from open anaerobic sludge tanks and drying beds;• reduction in open release of CH4 from landfill disposal site;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of electricity production from fossil fuels;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of heat generation from fossil fuels.The project had been implemented in two stages:- Erection of a new digester system consisting of 4 digesters, 7,000 m3 each, designed,supplied and erected by PASSAVANT ROEDIGER Anlagenbau.For destroying of the excess methane in case of emergency a flaring system have beenimplemented, consisting of 2 x DN150 flares, type ZA1-F2-0/N0 designed andmanufactured by HEGWEIN GmbH, Germany.- Erection of 3 new co-generation sets GE JMS 320 GS-B.LC with 1,063 kW electriccapacity each and 1,088 kW thermal capacity, for generation of electric and thermalenergy by combusting biogas from digesters.The digesters were commissioned at the end of 2006 and started operation on 01 January 2007but due to some technical problems in the adjustment of the biological process the generation ofbiogas was interrupted in the end of June 2007 and resumed on 01 May 2008, so the firstindustrial quantities of biogas were registered in May, 2008.The CHP was commissioned and started generating electricity and thermal energy for plant’sneeds in November, 2009.",61769,AMS-I.C.

To have access to clean water, Guineans are harvesting wood from local forests and mangroves.  This wood is burned to boil the water to make it safe to drink.  Through this practice, carbon and other particulate matter are released into the environment. 
 
Project Blue seeks to eliminate the current carbon-emitting and deforestation practices through use of a gravity-fed, water filter that eliminates virtually all harmful bacteria.

The project is owned and operated by Hanbao Livestock & Farming Products Company, Ltd. and implemented on their pig farm in Fangyuan Township, Changhua County, Taiwan. The project involves the capture of biogas from the pig farm’s wastewater treatment facility and the construction of a biogas generation plant to utilize the recovered biogas for electricity production. The project also involves the installation of wind turbines and solar PV. Currently, the biogas generation plant has an installed capacity of 65KW with another 195kw to be installed, for an installed capacity of 260KW. Currently, the solar PV system has an installed capacity of 963KW with another 490KW to be installed, for an installed capacity of 1,453KW.

Social and Environmental Benefits(1) Reduced methane emissions – Methane-rich biogas is a byproduct of waste decomposition. In the absence of the project, GHG emissions in the form of methane would be released directly into the atmosphere. The project will prevent methane emissions by capturing the biogas associated with pig waste treatment. (2) Renewable energy generation – The use of wind, solar, and biogas generated electricity neither creates water and air pollution not does it contribute to global climate change.

The leachate from Landfill II, after being analysed by the Municipal Department of Water and Sewage (Departamento Municipal de Água e Esgoto – DMAE), was authorized to be directly sent to the ETE Uberabinha without previous treatment. In this Project the Landfill I and the Landfill II were considered as a sole SDWS, since the area surrounding the two sites, including them, is owned and operated by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. and they are physically near enough to permit the joint operation. In fact, only a 27 m width road used exclusively for the landfilling operation separates the two sites, and the gas station and power plant of the proposed project activity are planned to be installed on the roadside between the Landfill I and Landfill II. Therefore, the estimative of emissions of methane from SWDS considered the two sites as one single SWDS.The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the Uberlândia landfills I and II project activity at the Uberlândia Landfill is the operation of the landfill with uncontrolled emission of the LFG (landfill gas) generated to the atmosphere, i.e. the LFG generated due to the decomposition of the organic matter is vented through the vertical wells installed at the landfill’s area. As will be demonstrated ahead, the existing scenario and the baseline scenario are the same.Emissions associated with the baseline scenario are the CH4 emissions due to the atmospheric release of the LFG and CO2 emissions due to the power generation from fossil-fuel power-plants. With the implementation of the project, the LFG previously released will be collected through the installation of pipelines and emission reduction will be achieved through the destruction of the gas collected in a flaring system and in the power plant. Additionally, the project will export renewable electricity to the grid, avoiding the dispatch of the same amount of electricity from fossil-fuel based power plants in the Brazilian National Grid.The project will bring benefits to sustainable development, as follows:-Increase of local environmental quality: the project will contribute not only through the avoidance of GHG emissions to the atmosphere, but also by displacing the fossil fuel consumption from power plants connected to the Brazilian Electric Grid. The project might also be seen as a good practice of correct solid waste final disposal;-Labour capaciting / Income generation: the project will need qualified operators to maintain the gas collection wells and pipeline and to operate the degassing station and the power plant. A team composed by engineers and technicians will be created and trained by international consultants and manufacturers. The revenues of these personnel will be above the market, as the technology employed is new in the Uberlândia region;-Integration with different sectors: using LFG to generate electricity is relatively new in Brazil – some projects were developed only under the CDM and only a few of them are indeed generating electricity (like the Bandeirantes Landfill Gas to Energy Project, São João Landfill Gas to Energy Project and Exploitation of the biogas from Controlled Landfill in Solid Waste Management Central – CTRS / BR.040). Therefore, the project will have an enormous contribution over the integration with the electric sectors.Project start date: 03/05/2011This is the date of creation of Energas Geração de Energia Ltda., composed by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. and Asja Brasil Serviços para o Meio Ambiente Ltda. exclusively for the development of the Project.",141878,ACM0001 Flaring or use of landfill gas,Large Scale,Standalone,,0

The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lanka’s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri. Several community service initiatives are being implemented by the project participant. Estimated project start date: 23/08/2008",18768,AMS-I.D.

The four Cooperative societies; Adisakthi, Ananthasakthi, Mahilasakthi and Durgasakthi cooperatives are located in Chennekothapalli, Roddam, Ramagiri and Penukonda Mandals respectively in Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, India and are functional in the region for nearly one and a half decades. Mahasakthi Cooperative Federation encourages independent, sustainable and viable alternative economic institutions of women focussing on women’s leadership, their legal rights and political empowerment. The purpose of the project activity is to set up 6,000 biogas plants (digesters) of 2m3 capacity each for single households having minimum of two cows and place to build biogas digester in four Mandals of Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, and in this way replace Non-Renewable Biomass with biogas for cooking and heating water. A biogas plant of 2 m3 capacity is sufficient to provide cooking fuel to a family of four to five . Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh State is a biomass deficit region . Fuel wood scarcity has an impact directly on rural households, which are highly dependent on this fuel. Demand for fuel wood and logs from commons and forests have caused resource degradation to the extent that collection exceeds sustainable yield. Forest degradation on the other hand leads to fuel wood scarcity leading to unsustainable removal of biomass to meet the demands. The project activity will attenuate the rural thermal energy needs used for cooking and water heating. Each household will install a 2 m3 biogas plant and cattle dung will be put into the anaerobic digester (Deenabandhu biogas Model). The technology is tried and tested in India , and has been in use for many years. By utilizing this cattle dung in a controlled anaerobic digestion and combustion system, biogas will be available for cooking energy and heating water. Biogas will be used on a two-ring gas stove having 4 inch burner, with a flame temperature of 870oC , supplied as part of the project activity. Implementation of the project depends on the successful validation and registration as a CDM project activity since the project will be financed completely from carbon revenues. After the project is registered as a CDM activity, carbon forward funding will enable the construction of domestic bio-digesters. An end user agreement will be signed between the PP, the Mahasakthi MAC Samakhya Ltd and the end user after construction, wherein the end user is aware of emission reductions from the use of biogas, and are willing to give up their rights and transfer the credit ownership to the Project Proponent, the Mahasakthi MAC Samakhya Ltd. Each household will feed cattle dung into the anaerobic digester which is a renewable source. The methane from the digester will be burnt to generate thermal energy thus replacing non-renewable firewood.

2496,2564,Expanding access to LPG in Haiti through microfinance services,Entrepreneurs du Monde,Gold Standard Certified Project,"13,15,3",Energy Efficiency - Domestic,Haiti,"In Haiti more than 90% of the population cooks on charcoal-based stoves and do so using so called traditional ones. Such stoves are considered non-efficient and require large amount of charcoal to operate which translate into a significant cost for the user. More than 1.4 million tons of charcoal is this way used each year.  This  over-consumption  is  not  sustainable  and  is  an  important  reason  behind  the  acute deforestation and soil erosion problems found in this country. On top of that, emissions of greenhouse gas resulting from the burning of charcoal, significantly participate to the global problem that is climate change. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called PALMIS Enèji with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all.  This  program  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distribute  more  efficient  charcoal cookstoves,  LGP  cookstoves  and  solar  lanterns.  PALMIS Enèji is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. A new microcredit financial product is also  being  developed  with  the  support  of  ID  Microfinance  (a  local  microfinance  institution  and  also  a program  of  Entrepreneurs  du  Monde)  to  help  people  with  limited  financial  means  to  have  to  access  to those products. Finally, PALMIS Enèji is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as much as possible energy products in Haiti. The project activity  “Expanding LPG access in Haiti through microfinance services""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  charcoal  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fighting  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  gas  such  as  carbon  monoxide  inside households. Indeed, the combustion of charcoal with traditional stoves, generates toxic gas in the air.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cook stove,  instead  of  a  traditional  one,  means  the  end  user  is  saving significant amount of money because less fuel is needed for her/his cooking needs.",8623,GS TPDDTEC v 1.,Small Scale,Standalone,,0

The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de Leña en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution.",42222,AMS-II.G.

Around 30% of Lao population lacks access to a source of improved drinking water and are at risk of getting diarrhoea or other water borne diseases. Though, a significant fraction of Lao population treats water preferable by boiling using woody biomass, charcoal etc to make the water safe for drinking. There is a significant fraction of families even cannot afford firewood to boil water, hence are forced to continue to drink unsafe water.
TerraClear is a social enterprise, registered as a private limited company under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The enterprise is in the business of getting clean water to more people in Laos by selling the Lao Ceramic Water Purifier (CWP) to the population. CWP’s help people access safe drinking water, especially in rural areas, reduce time spent provisioning drinking water or collecting wood, reduce costs for families, reduce child and adult morbidity and mortality, improving attendance at school and increased productivity. Ceramic Water Purifiers provide for removal of microorganisms from water by gravity filtration through porous ceramics, with a typical flow rate at production of 1.5 - 3 litres per hour.  Originally TerraClear plans to sell over 100,000 CWP’s between 2012 and 2019 but this target seems a bit high as up to mid-2018, the total sale is just about 58,000 filters. It is estimated that by the end of its first crediting period (15th July 2019), the total sale would be about 67,000 CWPs.
 
With the new target, CWPs will provide safe drinking water for potentially more than 0.3 million people, and at the same time reduce the demand for water treatment through boiling water with non- renewable biomass. The CWP’s have a useful life of 5 years or more provided proper care and maintenance. The Lao Ceramic Water Purifiers are manufactured locally in Laos and therefore contribute to building a local industry and value added in Laos, as well as creating much needed sustainable jobs and business opportunities in rural areas. The project start date is 06/06/2012.  With the assistance of carbon finance, TerraClear can become a unique and on-going sustainable enterprise capable of providing emissions-free household water treatment options to rural households, and thereby improve public health, household welfare and economy, as well as contribute to reduced deforestation in Lao PDR.",33541,GS TPDDTEC v 1.,Large Scale,Standalone,,0

The terms “Republic of Haiti"" or “Haiti"" will be used interchangeably throughout this document when referring to the host country where this proposed CPA01 will be implemented. The improved heat transfer efficiency of the EcoRecho stoves will result in reduced charcoal fuel consumption for cooking, thus reducing the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted into the atmosphere. Emission reductions (ER) occurring through implementation of CPA01 will be calculated using an approved small-scale CDM (SSC) baseline and monitoring methodology AMS.II.G version 04 for energy efficiency project activities. The proposed CPA01 will be limited to a maximum thermal energy saving equal to the SSC threshold of 180 GigaWatt-hour per year (GWhr/year).",41227,AMS-II.G.

The improved charcoal model has been shown to reduce charcoal consumption in households by an average of 50%. The improved stove will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously offering benefits to families in the form of relief from high fuel costs and reduced exposure to health-damaging airborne pollutants. Additionally, the project will create over 80 permanent jobs and countless business opportunities in the country. Projected CO2 emissions reductions are more than 30,000 tons for the first year of the first CPA and will continue to rise as the project expands.  The introduction of efficient charcoal stoves into the market will require considerable financial investment, technical training, and management resources.  These resources are scarce in Haiti, particularly the availability of project financing funds.  Due to its high costs of operation and low margin on the charcoal stove the project is dependent on carbon financing being available and its launch is subject to approval from the leading voluntary emissions standard bodies. D&E will manufacture the EcoRecho stoves locally and will sell it through its network of distributors and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs. Enel Trade SpA (Enel) will purchase the Emission Reduction credits from the CPAs under the PoA, and will provide D&E up-front financing to install stove manufacturing machinery needed to scale up the project from the current pilot phase.",0,AMS-II.G.

2798,1146,Expanding access to LPG in Burkina Faso through microfranchised distribution,Entrepreneurs du Monde,Gold Standard Certified Project,"13,15,3",Energy Efficiency - Domestic,Burkina Faso,"In Burkina Faso, non-renewable woodfuel represents ninety-one (91) per cent of the total energy consumed yearly. Indeed, eighty-four (84) per cent of households use wood and charcoal on a daily basis. For that reason, there is a growing pressure on forests and the country currently looses 105,000 hectares of forested land every year according to the Ministry in charge of environmental issues (“Ministère de l’environnement et du développement durable""). High efficiency improved cookstoves and gas stoves help fight deforestation by significantly reducing the demand for wood and charcoal, and thus contribute to a global reduction in GHG emissions from biomass combustion. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called Nafa Naana with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all. Nafa Naana takes place in the context of the National Plan for the Environment (PANE) established in 1991 by the Government of Burkina Faso, and is financially supported by the Ministry of Mines, Quarries and Energy. Nafa Naana  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distributes  more  efficient  charcoal and wood stoves,  LGP  stoves  and  solar  lanterns.  Nafa Naana is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. Financial services are offered to Nafa Naana clients either as group loans or individual loans to help  people  with  limited  financial  means  access those products. Finally, Nafa Naana is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as many energy products as possible in Burkina Faso. The project activity  “Expanding access to LPG in Burkina Faso through microfranchised distribution""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  wood  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fight  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  fumes  such  as  carbon  monoxide and PM 2.5 inside the homes of the beneficiary population. Indeed, the combustion of wood with traditional stoves releases toxic fumes in the air. These toxic fumes are one of the main causes of respiratory diseases among women and children.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cookstoves,  instead  of   traditional  ones,  means  that the  end  user  is  saving significant amounts of money because fuel expenses per gram of food cooked are lower for LPG than for wood when the wood is purchased by the user.",8877,GS TPDDTEC v 2.,Micro scale,Standalone,,0

• InfraVest Chungwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 29.9 MW (13x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Dajia and Da-An Townships, Taichung County, which covers Taichung phases I and III, and Dafong sites, and which comprises 13 wind turbines (hereafter: Chungwei Wind Farm). There are another 20 wind turbines also located in Dajia and Da- An Townships, Taichung County, which belong to the same project owner. But these 20 turbines belong to the project owner’s another GS VER project (GS472), which was already registered in 2010. Therefore, the 13 wind turbines in Chungwei Wind Farm under the project are the capacity addition to the existing grid-connected renewable power plant (project GS472).
• InfraVest Tauwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 4.6 MW (2x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Guanyin Township (also called Hsinwu Wind Farm), Taoyuan County, which comprises 2 wind turbines (hereafter: Tauwei Wind Farm). There are another 19 wind turbines also located in Guanyin Township, Taoyuan County, which belong to the same project owner. But these 19 turbines belong to the project owner’s another GS VER project (GS612), which was already registered in 2011. Therefore, the 2 wind turbines in Tauwei Wind Farm under the project are the capacity addition to the existing grid-connected renewable power plant (project GS612).
The above-mentioned four wind farms are constructed and operated by InfraVest Wind Power Group (hereafter refer as “InfraVest”), which is a subsidiary of Germany based VWind AG. The project in total comprises 42 wind turbines and the total installed capacity of the bundled project is 92.4 MW. At full capacity, the aggregated output of the project is expected to be of 250,866 MWh/year, which is to be delivered to the state-owned power grid, Taipower grid (“TPG”), displacing part of the electricity supplied by the power grid currently dominated by fossil fuel-fired power plants. Accordingly, the project will lead to carbon dioxide emission reduction. The annual emission reductions are estimated as 190,908 tCO2e/year, and the total emission reductions for the first crediting period of 7 years are estimated as 1,336,356 tCO2e.",264960,ACM0002 Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources,Large scale,Standalone,,0
